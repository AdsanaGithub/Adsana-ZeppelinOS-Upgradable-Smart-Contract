Adsana ZeppelinOS SANA-UT Ethereum ERC20 Utility Token Upgradable Smart Contract

ZeppelinOS 
Is a platform designed specifically to develop, deploy and operate any smart contract project securely as well as allowing for seamless upgrades.

The need for and idea of ZeppelinOS originated from our audit and OpenZeppelin work. By working with our clients, we discovered that the fear of being hacked or of contracts being buggy was the main reason they were paying us good money for our audits and using OpenZeppelinâ€™s community-vetted contracts.

By working closely with more than 50 projects  found that smart contract development had lots of pain beyond standardization and security (which we tackled quite successfully with OZ). We discovered that all smart contract developers shared the same pain points:



The contract is configured to distribute SANA-UT utility tokens to Ethereum ERC20 compatible wallet addresses. These can be addresses for Adsana application specific functionalities, payments, rewards, treasury, token holders, team, bounties and airdrops.

The SANAUT solidity smart contract code has been tested and launched on the Ropsten test network, the official Ethereum Etherscan Network. The smart contract code distributed tokens to test Ethereum ERC20 wallet addresses for less than $5 in Ethereum gas cost and has the ability to do this to an unlimited number of addresses for under $10 in Ethereum gas cost, which is better than ideal.

# Open Zeppelin / ZeppelinOS.  The defacto leaders in open and secure smart contract code. 

Zeppelin Research started performing security audits as a way to push the industry to grow and mature. and to grow their network of allies in the space. Many big names such as the Ethereum Foundation, Augur, DFINITY and numerous others rely on their expertise and secure smart contract codebase. Zeppelin Research has helped key projects achieve their goals without being hacked, and freely share their knowledge to the world for reuse and adaptation.
